# Pivy-print
Chrome extension to print cards, similar to those, generated by [https://taskcardmaker.appspot.com](https://taskcardmaker.appspot.com/editor) from Pivotal Tracker. There're few versions which might merge in the future (be sure to check [version section](#versions))

## How to install
To install extension, you'll have to obtain its source
``` git clone git@github.com:sudodoki/pivy-print.git ```
or download the [zip archive](https://github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/archive/master.zip).
Click the Chrome menu icon ![three lines icon](http://developer.chrome.com/static/images/hotdogmenu.png)  and select Extensions from the Tools menu. Ensure that the "Developer mode" checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked. Now you can reload extensions, load an unpacked directory of files as if it were a packaged extension, and more. Click 'Load unpacked extensions...' and select folder with plugin.
Before using the plugin, you may have to set some options (otherwise it will be defaulted to using DOM parsing). Click plugin icon ![printer](https://raw.github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/master/icon.png) in your address bar panel. You should see the options page:

You can use either simple DOM parsing (same, as v0.5 of the plugin) or API (will come in handy when we add more fields) - in latter case you'll have to input the Pivotal API key (you can find it at the bottom of [your profile page](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/profile) ).
Option page also grants you ability to edit cards css (as well as of other elements, since it's just being injected into page, but shhh..)
Now on your pivotal project page you should see the extra item in 'Stories â–¼' dropdown - Print

After selecting some stories, click the Print button from dropdown

Tested with Chrome 26.

## Versions
So, there're these versions in the wild:
* [v0.5](https://github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/tree/v0.5). [Download zip](https://github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/archive/v0.5.zip). Provides basic cards based on html parsing. Cards state title, type, id and points (for features). Just plug it in - no settings, no API keys, check some checkboxes for stories and click print to print those out.
* [v0.8](https://github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/tree/v0.8). [Download zip](https://github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/archive/v0.8.zip). Provides basic cards based on API responses. Cards state title, type, id and points (for features). Need to input API key using extension's popup.

## TODO

* Add text fields to edit cards before print.  
* Add ability to edit templates for cards
