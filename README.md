# Pivy-print
Chrome extension to print cards, similar to those, generated by [https://taskcardmaker.appspot.com](https://taskcardmaker.appspot.com/editor) from Pivotal Tracker. There're few versions which might merge in the future (be sure to check [version section](#versions))

## How to install
To install extension, you'll have to obtain its source
``` git clone git@github.com:sudodoki/pivy-print.git ```
or download the [zip archive](https://github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/archive/master.zip).
Click the Chrome menu icon ![three lines icon](http://developer.chrome.com/static/images/hotdogmenu.png)  and select Extensions from the Tools menu. Ensure that the "Developer mode" checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked. Now you can reload extensions, load an unpacked directory of files as if it were a packaged extension, and more. Click 'Load unpacked extensions...' and select folder with plugin.
Before using the plugin, you have to input your Pivotal Tracker API key. To do so, visit [your profile page](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/profile) and find the API key section (at the bottom).
Click the print icon ![printer](https://raw.github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/images/icon.png) in your address bar panel. You should see the  
![first_time_popup](https://raw.github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/images/first_time_popup.png)  
Enter your API key (you can change it later).
Now on your pivotal project page you should see the extra item in 'Stories â–¼' dropdown - Print

Tested with Chrome 26.

## Versions
So, there're these versions in the wild:
* [v0.5](https://github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/tree/v0.5). [Download zip](https://github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/archive/v0.5.zip). Provides basic cards based on html parsing. Cards state title, type, id and points (for features). Just plug it in - no settings, no API keys, check some checkboxes for stories and click print to print those out.


## TODO

* Add text fields to edit cards before print.  
* Considering this: next version might work with pivotal API to provide full info on stories (now only story titles are used).
