# Pivy-print
Chrome extension to print cards, similar to those, generated by [https://taskcardmaker.appspot.com](https://taskcardmaker.appspot.com/editor) from Pivotal Tracker. There're few versions which might merge in the future (be sure to check [version section](#versions))

## How to install
To install extension, you'll have to obtain its source
``` git clone git@github.com:sudodoki/pivy-print.git ```
or download the [zip archive](https://github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/archive/master.zip).
Click the Chrome menu icon ![three lines icon](http://developer.chrome.com/static/images/hotdogmenu.png)  and select Extensions from the Tools menu. Ensure that the "Developer mode" checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked. Now you can reload extensions, load an unpacked directory of files as if it were a packaged extension, and more. Click 'Load unpacked extensions...' and select folder with plugin.
Before using the plugin, you may have to set some options (otherwise it will be defaulted to using DOM parsing). Click plugin icon ![printer](https://raw.github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/master/icon.png) in your address bar panel. You should see the options page:  

![option_page](https://raw.github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/images/options_page.png)  
You can use either simple DOM parsing (same, as v0.5 of the plugin) or API (will come in handy when we add more fields) - in latter case you'll have to input the Pivotal API key (you can find it at the bottom of [your profile page](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/profile) ).
Option page also grants you ability to edit cards css (as well as of other elements, since it's just being injected into page, but shhh..)
Now on your pivotal project page you should see the extra item in 'Stories ▼' dropdown - Print

After selecting some stories, click the Print button from dropdown

Tested with Chrome 26.

## Customize pivy-print
In order to meet the different needs and circumstances that arise across various agile-based teams, you might need to somehow change pivy-print cards so that it's easier/more useful for you to use. (Be sure to [write about it](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pivy-print-general), so that it might be added to the extension)


### Cusomizing CSS
On the options page (if in trouble finding it, consult [installation section](#how-to-install)) press 'Toggle the css edit' button (![press to enlarge](https://raw.github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/images/edit_css3_thumb.jpg)(https://raw.github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/images/edit_css3.jpg)), edit css in field. To see the outcome, press 'Check the css' button (![press to enlarge]([)https://raw.github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/images/edit_css2_thumb.jpg)(https://raw.github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/images/edit_css2.jpg)) . In case you're satisfied, press 'Save options' at the bottom, otherwise just close/refresh tab to keep your previous settings. (![press to enlarge](https://raw.github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/images/edit_css1_thumb.jpg)(https://raw.github.com/sudodoki/pivy-print/images/edit_css1.jpg))

### Customizing cards' template
In your card template you can add any static info, text decoration etc. Also, if you're using API calls (you've inserted your key on options page), you can use next fields:
+id, 
+project_id, 
+story_type, 
+url, 
+current_state, 
+description, 
+name, 
+requested_by, 
+owned_by, 
+created_at, 
+updated_at, 
+labels.
